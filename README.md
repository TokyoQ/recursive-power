### Tower of Hanoi

A classic puzzle involving a board which has 3 vertical poles and a variable number of round discs. Each disc has a different diameter but all can be slid onto any of the 3 poles.

Initially, all of the discs are in a tower on the leftmost pole, with the largest disc on the bottom of the pile, with the smallest on the top. The rules are that no disc can be placed on top of a smaller disc and the goal is to move the whole tower to the rightmost pole.
